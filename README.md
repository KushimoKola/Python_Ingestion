- May 11, 2022
- Code not working yet because `schedules` and `requests` were not getting imported; to revisit soon

- Running pip install on mac
    - https://www.mytecbits.com/internet/python/installing-python-packages
    - Search and start Terminal: Create New Integrated Terminal. The terminal panel will open at the bottom.
    - In the terminal run these comments.
        `python3 -m venv env`
        `source env/bin/activate`

    - A new virtual environment called env is now created for the workspace. To see this, go to the explorer panel and expand the newly created folder under the workspace.

    - Open the Command Palette again and search and select Python:: Select Interpreter. Now you will see the newly created virtual environmnet (something similar to Python 3.7.3 64-bit (‘env’, venv)). Select the virtual environment as your interpreter.

    - Virtual environment is ready. Now we will see how to install a Python package.
